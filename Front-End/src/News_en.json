    "Title": "Three-Year Anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine War: A Glimmer of Peace? Direct US-Russia Negotiations Spark International Concern",
    "Content": "The Russia-Ukraine war has now reached its third anniversary, with hostilities still raging on. However, new developments have emerged in efforts toward peace negotiations. U.S. President Trump has been actively mediating by engaging in direct talks with Russian President Putin, seeking to broker a ceasefire agreement. Nonetheless, the format of exclusive U.S.-Russia negotiations and the Trump administration’s hardline stance on Ukraine have triggered strong concerns within the international community, especially among European allies.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, Russia has yet to accept it. After a phone call between Trump and Putin, the two sides reached a preliminary agreement under which Russia would suspend attacks on Ukraine’s energy facilities for 30 days and enter technical negotiations on a Black Sea maritime truce, a comprehensive ceasefire, and permanent peace. They also agreed to a prisoner exchange. However, the Kremlin later stated that the Black Sea ceasefire agreement would take effect only after multiple sanctions against Russian banks, manufacturers, and exporters are lifted, complicating the negotiations further.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S.-Ukraine relations have grown tense over negotiations for a mineral agreement. The United States seeks to secure economic benefits from Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction through the agreement and obtain a share of profits from its mineral resources, while Ukraine demands clearer security guarantees from the U.S. President Zelensky stated at a press conference that he would be willing to resign for the sake of peace, and might even consider joining NATO in exchange, but he refuses to sign any deal that would harm future generations of Ukrainians.\n\nThe exclusive nature of U.S.-Russia negotiations has raised international apprehension. European allies fear that the United States might sacrifice Ukraine for its own interests. French President Emmanuel Macron warned President Trump that “peace must never mean Ukraine’s surrender.” Additionally, the international community is concerned that China might take advantage of the situation in Ukraine to expand its influence in Europe.\n\nThe Ukrainian battlefield remains in a stalemate. Despite the military’s determined resistance, the three-year war has caused significant casualties and economic losses. Ukraine urgently needs continued assistance from the international community, particularly in terms of military and economic support from the United States. With the future of peace talks still unclear, Ukrainians continue to live under the shadow of war. In frontline cities such as Bilytsky, only the elderly, women, children, and soldiers remain, striving to survive amid the conflict. The fate of Ukraine, and even the geopolitical landscape of Europe and the wider world, hinges on the outcome of the upcoming negotiations.",
